I made this project together with two other people for a client named ResponsibleIT, a research group based at the HvA.
They were researching the behavior of social networks and wanted a simulator to demonstrate why and how content bubbles are created.

They had already built this simulator in Python, using the logic and formulas behind their research, but it didnâ€™t work well, and the UI and UX were almost non-existent.
Our job was to implement this logic with webtechnology in a website with an intuitive user interface so that users would more easily understand what was happening.

In the end, we created a simulator where the user can build their own social environment and click Play to see the simulation in action.
At first, it was hard to understand what you were looking at. To fix this, we implemented several APIs to give faces to the people in the network and added a phone interface with real posts that users can like, along with other interactive options, all within a user interface that feels familiar.
We built this without a framework, using only HTML, CSS, and object-oriented JavaScript (something we specifically wanted to learn).

We completed the project in five weeks and had three client meetings. The client was very impressed and happy with the result. They even wanted to use it as a foundation for future feature implementations.

What I learned the most was how to work with a client who had a clear vision for the result, while still giving us the freedom to apply our own expertise to create something truly valuable. And I also learned how we could use Object Oriented Programming to our advantage while using vanilla JavaScript.
