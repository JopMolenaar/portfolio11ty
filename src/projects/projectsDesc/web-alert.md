Web Alert is a project I created to graduate from my CMD studies at the HvA.
The project focuses on better protecting elderly people against online scams and giving them more self-confidence when using digital devices.

The idea to research and build something in this area came from my own experiences, my social circle, and news articles about the problem.
Because I’m already quite technical, I wanted to approach this project differently and step out of my comfort zone. Normally, I would start programming as soon as I had an idea, but that often costs a lot of time in the end. For this project, I went to the elderly, explored ways to research this group, and documented everything. Using different research methods gave me multiple insights.

Some key insights were: A tool that automatically checks for scams is something they want, most of them don’t like change and asking for help feels trustworthy and is something they already do.

These insights led me to the idea of building a tool that helps them in a way they recognize from the offline world, instead of trying to teach them something new.

This led me to build a web extension that they or their family members can install with just one click. It checks whether a domain is safe by using the check.veiliginternetten.nl API and the politie.nl API. If the site is unsafe, the user receives advice on what to do, and they can also send the information via email to someone they trust.

Because web extensions don’t work on mobile phones, I created a website where users can fill in a short form with four questions. At the end of the form, they receive a link with a few extra steps to add a shortcut to their device. This shortcut lets them ask for help within two clicks and provide more information about what they see, resulting in better advice.

I tested this product multiple times throughout different stages of the prototype. This resulted in a very effective process and a happy user in the end. The feeling that they can ask for help at any time, while also being able to see if a website is safe or not, gives them more self-confidence when using digital devices.
