<p>Web Alert is a project that I did to graduate from my study CMD at the HvA.
The project is about protecting elderly more against online scams, and giving them more self-confidence on digital devices.
This idea to research and build something for this came from my own experiences, my social circle and newsarticles about this problem.</p>
