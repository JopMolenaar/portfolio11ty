<p>I made this project with a team of two other persons for a client named ResponsibleIT, a research group based in the HvA.
They researched the behaviour of a social network and wanted a simulator to show people how it works and why and how contentbubbles are created.
They had already build this simulator in phyton, but it did not work very well and the UI and UX were non existent.
Our job was to implement this logic in a intuative user interface so that the user would be more likely to understand what is going on.</p>
