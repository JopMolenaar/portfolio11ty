    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>
        Hello I am Jop Molenaar, 21 years old and studying Communication and 
        Multi-Media Design on the HvA. 
        I am interested in full stack development, IoT
        and optimizing the UX of the product. I also love to
        write a lot of logic with Javascript and to learn
        new things. I can work individually but I also
        worked many times in a team before and I like the
        team aspect of helping each other out and making
        something together. Besides that, I am a very
        disciplined, calm and nice guy that has a great
        passion for calisthenics.

                        <p>We made an Internet of Things check-in system that consists out of an embedded system and a web environment for a real client from the HvA. We used a Raspberry Pi 4, esp32, a display, a camera to read the details from the student card and a NFC reader to make checking in and out fast after the first time you have registered your student card. On the website the teachers could link devices to events by linking the event with the mac address of the device. They could see upcoming, open and closed events, they could link student to events, they could see which student is/was present or not at the event, and we build some more nice UX features to meet the users needs. The client was very enthusiastic and was planning to use the device next school year.</p>

                        <p>This project was about learning and discovering the true power of CSS by only using css selectors and no Javascript to see what you can do with it nowadays. I wanted to make a cockpit of an UFO that has working buttons, a working joystick and that you can move through space with different speeds all with css only (accept the js needed for the range input). Be aware that the animation of the UFO moving through space is pretty heavy for your machine, so I advice you to watch it at least on a decent laptop. </p>

                        </div>
                        <p>In this project which involved using APIs, and discovering features of the web you didn&#39;t know before, I made a chat app like WhatsApp and other messaging apps. I build the application with node.js, Javascript, Liquid and css. I used server-sent events to let the receiver get the texts, idle detection to know if the user is active or not and I worked with service workers to be able to install the PWA and to use the push notifications api to send notifications to the user if he is not online. I tried some experimental things during this project and one of them is that I did not set up a database. I stored the messages on the server in the beginning. After a while I used <code>fs</code> to store them in a json file instead of the server. But render, the service where I have put my webapp online, resets the content of these files when the server restarts. And because I didn&#39;t wanted to set up a database, I thought of something different. I made a private github repository, generated an access token, and now I store and get the data from my own github api/database. </p>

                        <p>I made a check in device at my minor Internet of Things on the HBO-ICT. I had no experience with embedded systems and many more things when starting this minor. But I managed to build an embedded system with a website where I could check the data. </p>
