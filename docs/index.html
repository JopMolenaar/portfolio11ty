        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>
            Hello I am Jop, 21 years old and recently finished my study Communication and 
            Multi-Media Design on the HvA, <span class="highlight">with honor</span>. 
            <br></br>
            I am a very enthusiastic and driven front-end developer who loves to learn new things and improve myself.
            My main focus is optimising UX with logic and the posibilities given by the web, prioritising accessibility and implementing pixel perfect design. 
            I can work individually but I also worked many times in a team and I like helping eachother and making
            something together. 
            <br></br>
            Besides that, I am a very disciplined, calm and nice guy that has a great
            passion for calisthenics. A sport that requires a lot of patience, perseverance, vision and flexibility, something I also try show in my work ethic.
        </p>

            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>
                My experience as someone who recently graduated is mainly from school projects and internships. 
                But that doesn't mean I don't know how a companies workflow works, what is expected and how to reach the end goal.             
                <br></br>
                During my internships I worked on projects for big clients like Peakz Padel, Patientenfederatie, OBA and many more. 
                I did not only fix bugs, I implemented features, created components in a way the client could build their own pages, 
                optimised the user experience and focused on implementing pixel perfect design. All that in an agile enviroment where we worked 
                in a team consisting of developers, designers and project managers. This resulted in a lot of happy clients, learnings 
                and experience.
                <br></br>
                In recent projects I worked with Craft CMS, Vue.js/Nuxt, CSS, JavaScript, Twig and Git.
                But I like to experiment with new techniques and because of my base knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, 
                I tend to learn and adapt to other frameworks or templating languages quite fast.

                            <p>We made an Internet of Things check-in system that consists out of an embedded system and a web environment for a real client from the HvA. We used a Raspberry Pi 4, esp32, a display, a camera to read the details from the student card and a NFC reader to make checking in and out fast after the first time you have registered your student card. On the website the teachers could link devices to events by linking the event with the mac address of the device. They could see upcoming, open and closed events, they could link student to events, they could see which student is/was present or not at the event, and we build some more nice UX features to meet the users needs. The client was very enthusiastic and was planning to use the device next school year.</p>

                            <p>This project was about learning and discovering the true power of CSS by only using css selectors and no Javascript to see what you can do with it nowadays. I wanted to make a cockpit of an UFO that has working buttons, a working joystick and that you can move through space with different speeds all with css only (accept the js needed for the range input). Be aware that the animation of the UFO moving through space is pretty heavy for your machine, so I advice you to watch it at least on a decent laptop. </p>

                            <p>We created a website featuring data from the past 10 years of CSS Day for its 10th anniversary. This project was developed during a 3.5-day hackathon where we competed against other groups. Our website had to be accessible and needed to have progressive enhancement. The judges were Peter Paul Koch and Krijn Hoetmer. Ultimately, our team won the hackathon, earning free tickets to CSS Day along with another group.</p>

                            <p>In this project which involved using APIs, and discovering features of the web you didn&#39;t know before, I made a chat app like WhatsApp and other messaging apps. I build the application with node.js, Javascript, Liquid and css. I used server-sent events to let the receiver get the texts, idle detection to know if the user is active or not and I worked with service workers to be able to install the PWA and to use the push notifications api to send notifications to the user if he is not online. I tried some experimental things during this project and one of them is that I did not set up a database. I stored the messages on the server in the beginning. After a while I used <code>fs</code> to store them in a json file instead of the server. But render, the service where I have put my webapp online, resets the content of these files when the server restarts. And because I didn&#39;t wanted to set up a database, I thought of something different. I made a private github repository, generated an access token, and now I store and get the data from my own github api/database. </p>
